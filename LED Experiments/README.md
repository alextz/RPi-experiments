Blinnking LEDs
===============

This is a collection of Python scripts that make LEDs do stuff (mostly blink)

The Experiments:
---------------

### blink.py

This script was a first test to see if I could make an LED blink from the GPIO pins on the RPi...

### progressbar.py

This script lights up up to 6 LEDs (2 red, 2 yellow, 2 green) in a sort of audio meter style. Might extend it to make it controllable from a web interface / mobile app.
